# GDGC Web Development – Job Searching Portal

## Overview
The **Job Searching Portal** is a front-end based web application built to connect recruiters and job seekers in a simple and interactive way.  
It provides recruiters the ability to post job openings and manage listings, while job seekers can explore opportunities, filter results, view detailed job descriptions, and submit applications.  

The portal also includes:
- Dedicated tabs for **Companies**
- **Salary insights** in tabular form
- **Resources** for career growth
- A personalized **My Applications** section

## How It Works
1. **User Roles**
   - **Recruiters** can register, log in, and access the **Post a Job** feature.  
     They can submit details such as role, location, salary, and number of openings.
   - **Job Seekers** can browse jobs, filter them (by type or location), and apply directly.

2. **Job Listings**
   - Each job shows options for **Apply Now** and **View Details**.
   - The **details panel** displays requirements and full descriptions.

3. **Applications**
   - On successful application, a **confirmation message** is shown.
   - All applied jobs are stored in the **My Applications** tab.

4. **Navigation**
   - A top navigation bar allows switching between:
     - Jobs  
     - Companies  
     - Salaries  
     - Resources  
     - My Applications  

   Each section loads independently without overlapping content.
